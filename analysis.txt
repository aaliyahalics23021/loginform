Login Form Requirements Analysis
--------------------------------

Client Expectations:

1. Simple and clean login form for users to enter their credentials.
2. Use a modern design style called Glassmorphism (transparent, blurred backgrounds).
3. Responsive design - form should work well on mobile and desktop.
4. Include fields:
   - Username or email
   - Password
5. A submit button to login (no backend functionality needed for now).
6. Links for "Forgot password?" and "Register" (for user convenience).
7. Smooth animations or transitions on inputs for better UX.
8. Clear labels and focus effects to guide users.
9. The form should stand out on a background image.

Non-technical:

- The form should feel modern and welcoming.
- Easy to use, with readable text and visible fields.
- Should load quickly and not confuse users.
- Compatible with common browsers and screen sizes.
